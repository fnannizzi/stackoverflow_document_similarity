 <begin_tags>
javascript,operators,equality,equality-operator,identity-operator
<end_tags>
<begin_body>
<p>I'm using JSLint to go through some horrific JavaScript at work and it's returning a huge number of suggestions to replace <code>==</code> (two equals signs) with <code>===</code> (three equals signs) when doing things like comparing <code>idSele_UNVEHtype.value.length == 0</code> inside of an if statement.</p>

<p>Is there a performance benefit to replacing <code>==</code> with <code>===</code>? </p>

<p>Any performance improvement would probably be welcomed as there are hundreds (if not thousands) of these comparison operators being used throughout the file.</p>

<p>Would I be correct in assuming that if no type conversion takes place, there would be a small (probably extremely small) performance gain over <code>==</code>?</p>

<li>Wrap <code>sys.stdout</code> in an object that flushes after every write</li>
<li>Set <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED</code> env var</li>
<li><code>sys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'w', 0)</code></li>

<p>Is there any other way to set some global flag in <code>sys / sys.stdout</code> programmatically during execution ?</p>

How to clone a single branch in git?
<end_title>
 <begin_tags>

<end_tags>
<begin_body>
<p>I have a local git repository called 'skeleton' that I use for storing project skeletons. It has a few branches, for different kinds of projects:</p>

<pre><code>casey@agave [~/Projects/skeleton] git branch
* master
  rails
  c
  c++
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to check out the master branch for a new project, I can do</p>

<pre><code>casey@agave [~/Projects] git clone skeleton new
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/casey/Projects/new/.git/
</code></pre>

<p>and everything is how I want it. Specifically, the new master branch points to skeleton master branch, and I can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup.</p>

<p>What doesn't work, however, is if I want to clone another branch. I can't get it so that I only pull the branch I want, for instance the rails branch, and then the new repo has a 'master' branch that pushes to and pulls from the skeleton repo's 'rails' branch, by default.</p>

<p>Is there a good way to go about doing this? Or, maybe this isn't the way that git wants me to structure things, and I'm certainly open to that. Perhaps I should have multiple repos, with the rails skeleton repo tracking the master skeleton repo? And any individual project cloning the rails skeleton repo.</p>

<p>Any thoughts and suggestions are appreciated!</p>

<p>End Goal: have a picker view rotating a few icon sized images.</p>

<p>firstly i would like to change the black/grey boarder surrounding the spindle to a transparent colour. i.e. [UIColor clearColor];</p>

<p>Then shrink the picker view down so it is relatively small, (probably around 40 x 40 pixels)  Experimenting with this is IB did not make it seem easy.</p>

<p>Finally change the view returned to the picker for each section.  This i think is easy with</p>

<pre><code>pickerView:viewForRow:forComponent:reusingView:
</code></pre>

<p>The rest, not sure if it is possible or if i am going to have to delve into some of the core animation/graphics (or find a different way to do what i want).</p>
